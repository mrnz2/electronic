# Electronic Parts List Context

Before answering questions about electronic components, part selection, circuit design, or project suggestions:

1. **Read the parts list**: Open and read `ElectronicParts.csv` to see which parts are in stock (Name, Quantity, Description).
2. **Use it in answers**: When suggesting components, circuits, or modules, prefer or explicitly reference parts from this list when they fit. If the user doesn't have a part, say so and suggest the closest alternative from the list or note what they’d need to buy.
3. **Keep suggestions practical**: Base recommendations on actual stock (quantities and specs in the list) so answers are immediately actionable.

The list path: `ElectronicParts.csv` in the project root.
